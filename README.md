# ML-iris
## Using data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) to practice machine learning with scikit-learn

**Steps taken**
1. Imported data
2. Parsed data
3. Found a suitable model (KNN)
4. Checked the output by using the test set
5. Improved model by using a different algorithm (decision tree)

**Screenshot of Results**
Using the metrics function in sklearn to check classification accuracy, one can see that the KNN algorithm had a higher accuracy than the decision tree algorithm when test size=0.3 and k=4.
